## CI/CD Pipeline Using CircleCI

I used CircleCI to automate the deployment process of my frontend application onto AWS S3.

1. Created an AWS Access Key & Secret key

2. In my repositoryâ€™s root, I created a folder named .circleci and added a file config.yml with the necessary requirements.

3. Inside my CircleCI account I added environmental variables for region, & AWS Secret Access Key and Access Key that I made in step 1.
